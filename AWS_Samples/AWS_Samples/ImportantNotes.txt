Amazon Web Services offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services.
We need to use Access Key and Secret Key to access AWS. Also, we need to install nuget packages for each service.

1. S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, 
data availability, security, and performance.

In S3, we can do the following
	a. Create/List/Version Buckets
	b. Store/Upload files in bucket
	c. Store/Upload files in buckets with permissions
	d. Uplaod entire directory. All files in directory will be uploaded.
	e. Create a link for file uploaded, called preassigned url with expiry date.
	f. Tag objects
	g. Accelerate Buckets

2. Glacier
Its similar to S3, but its less costly. If we want to store data and use it frequently then use Glacier. Its also
less expensive.

3. SNS
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application
(A2A) and application-to-person.
